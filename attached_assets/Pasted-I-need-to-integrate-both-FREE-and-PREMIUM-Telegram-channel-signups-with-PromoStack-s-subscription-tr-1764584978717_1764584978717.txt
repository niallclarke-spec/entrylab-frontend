I need to integrate both FREE and PREMIUM Telegram channel signups with PromoStack's subscription tracking system.

## Two Different Flows:

### 1. FREE Channel Signup (Public Channel - Lead Capture Only)
When a user signs up for the free Gold Signals channel:
- Call PromoStack API to record the lead
- API returns success (no invite link needed)
- Show the user our STATIC public channel link: [YOUR_PUBLIC_CHANNEL_LINK]

Request:
POST https://dash.promostack.io/api/telegram/grant-access
Headers: 
  X-API-Key: [PROMOSTACK_API_KEY secret]
  Content-Type: application/json

Body:
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "name": "User Name",
  "planType": "Free Gold Signals",
  "amountPaid": 0
}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "inviteLink": null,
  "message": "Free lead captured successfully",
  "isFreeUser": true
}

Then show user the static public channel link.


### 2. PREMIUM Subscription (Private Channel - Stripe Payment)
When a user completes Stripe checkout for premium:
- Call PromoStack API with Stripe data
- Pull the ACTUAL amount and plan interval from Stripe
- API returns a UNIQUE private invite link

Request:
POST https://dash.promostack.io/api/telegram/grant-access
Headers:
  X-API-Key: [PROMOSTACK_API_KEY secret]
  Content-Type: application/json

Body:
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "name": "User Name",
  "planType": "<PLAN_TYPE_FROM_STRIPE>",  // See mapping below
  "amountPaid": <ACTUAL_AMOUNT_FROM_STRIPE>,
  "stripeCustomerId": "<FROM_STRIPE_EVENT>",
  "stripeSubscriptionId": "<FROM_STRIPE_EVENT>"
}

## IMPORTANT: Plan Type Mapping from Stripe

Pull the interval from Stripe's subscription/price data and map to planType:

| Stripe Interval      | planType Value                    |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 7-day / trial       | "Premium Forex Signals - 7 Day"   |
| month               | "Premium Forex Signals - Monthly" |
| lifetime / one-time | "Premium Forex Signals - Lifetime"|

How to get interval from Stripe:
- subscription.items.data[0].price.recurring.interval (for subscriptions)
- Or from product metadata if using one-time payments

How to get amount:
- session.amount_total / 100 (for checkout sessions)
- subscription.plan.amount / 100 (for subscription events)

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "inviteLink": "https://t.me/+UniquePrivateLink",
  "message": "Premium access granted successfully",
  "isFreeUser": false
}

Show user the inviteLink from the response.


## Questions for the codebase:
1. Where is the Stripe webhook handler for checkout.session.completed?
2. How do we access the price interval and amount from the Stripe session/subscription?
3. Where is the free channel signup form handled?
4. What is the static public channel link we show to free users?
5. Is PROMOSTACK_API_KEY already configured as a secret?
